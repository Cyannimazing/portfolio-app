SUBJECT: Full-Stack Developer for Local Business Directory

Hi there,

I'm interested in developing your local business directory. I'm a full-stack developer with experience in Next.js, React, TypeScript, Laravel, and MySQL—perfect for building searchable, database-driven directories with clean, responsive interfaces.

You can view my work at https://portfolio-cyannimazing.vercel.app/ where I've built similar data-driven applications with user authentication, filtering, and modern UI/UX design.

I'd love to understand your specific vision and work closely with you to bring it to life. I focus on creating user-friendly experiences with attention to detail throughout the entire development cycle.

Looking forward to discussing your project!

Best,
Cyril Jian B. Narvasa
